# AdventOfCode2021.jl

I originally completed [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) in the R language.
In this repository, I try to translate my solutions into Julia code, to see how the two languages compare in performance and style.

## Disclaimer

I have _no idea what I am doing_. I don't even know Julia or have any experience using it. I am very much making things up as I go along. Any suggestions for making the code simpler, faster or more idiomatic are gratefully received.
